  title: 'Steady-state Approximations for Hodgkin-Huxley Cell Models: Towards Multi-scale Models of Uterine Smooth Muscle'
  description: An effort at reducing the Tong et al. (2011) model into a smaller number of equations for computational efficiency – the 'reduced' Tong model – aims at reproducing the overall behaviour without excessive detail.
