    abstract = {Multi-scale mathematical bioelectrical models of organs such as the uterus, stomach or heart present challenges both for accuracy and computational tractability. These multi-scale models are typically founded on models of biological cells derived from the classic Hodkgin-Huxley (HH) formalism. Ion channel behaviour is tracked with dynamical variables representing activation or inactivation of currents that relax to steady-state dependencies on cellular membrane voltage. Timescales for relaxation may be orders of magnitude faster than companion ion channel variables or phenomena of physiological interest for the entire cell (such as bursting sequences of action potentials) or the entire organ (such as electromechanical coordination). Exploiting these time scales with steady-state approximations for relatively fast-acting systems is a well-known but often overlooked approach as evidenced by recent published models. We thus investigate feasibility of an extensive reduction of order for an HH-type cell model with steady-state approximations to the full dynamical activation and inactivation ion channel variables. Our effort utilises a published comprehensive uterine smooth muscle cell model that encompasses 19 ordinary differential equations and 105 formulations overall. The numerous ion channel submodels in the published model exhibit relaxation times ranging from order 10âˆ’1 to 105 milliseconds. Substitution of the faster dynamic variables with steady-state formulations demonstrates both an accurate reproduction of the full model and substantial improvements in time-to-solve, for test cases performed. Our demonstration here of an effective and relatively straightforward reduction method underlines the particular importance of considering time scales for model simplification before embarking on large-scale computations or parameter sweeps. As a preliminary complement to more intensive reduction of order methods such as parameter sensitivity and bifurcation analysis, this approach can rapidly and accurately improve computational tractability for challenging multi-scale organ modelling efforts.},

@article{haimurphy1988,
	abstract = {We have developed a minimum kinetic model for cross-bridge interactions with the thin filament in smooth muscle. The model hypothesizes two types of cross-bridge interactions: 1) cycling phosphorylated cross bridges and 2) noncycling dephosphorylated cross bridges ("latch bridges"). The major assumptions are that 1) Ca2+-dependent myosin phosphorylation is the only postulated regulatory mechanism, 2) each myosin head acts independently, and 3) latch bridges are formed by dephosphorylation of an attached cross bridge. Rate constants were resolved by fitting data on the time courses of myosin phosphorylation and stress development. Comparison of the rate constants indicates that latch-bridge detachment is the rate-limiting step. Model simulations predicted a hyperbolic dependence of steady-state stress on myosin phosphorylation, which corresponded with the experimental observation of high values of stress with low levels of phosphorylation in intact tissues. Model simulations also predicted the experimental observation that an initial phosphorylation transient only accelerates stress development, with no effect on the final steady-state levels of stress. Because the only Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism in this model was activation of myosin light chain kinase, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the latch state.},

@article{laforet2011,
	abstract = {A comprehensive multiscale model of the uterine muscle electrical activity would permit understanding the important link between the genesis and evolution of the action potential at the cell level and the process leading to labor. Understanding this link can open the way to more effective tools for the prediction of labor and prevention of preterm delivery. A first step toward the realization of such a model is presented here. By using as starting point a previously published model of the generation of the uterine muscle action potential at the cell level, a significant reduction of the model complexity is here achieved in order to simulate 2-D propagation of the cellular activity at the uterine tissue level, for tissue strips of arbitrary dimension. From the obtained dynamic behavior of the electrical activity simulated at the tissue level, the use of a previously validated volume conductor model at the organ level permits us to simulate the electrohysterogram as recorded on the abdominal surface by an electrode array. Qualitative evaluation of the model at the cell level and at the organ level confirms the potential of the proposed multiscale approach for further refinement and extension aiming at clinical application.},

@article{rihana2006,
	abstract = {The uterus is a physiological system consisting of a large number of interacting smooth muscle cells. The uterine excitability changes remarkably with time, generally quiescent during pregnancy, the uterus exhibits forceful synchronized contractions at term leading to fetus expulsion. These changes characterize thus a dynamical system susceptible of being studied through formal mathematical tools. Multiple physiological factors are involved in the regulation process of this complex system. Our aim is to relate the physiological factors to the uterine cell dynamic behaviors. Taking into account a previous work presented, in which the electrical activity of a uterine cell is described by a set of ordinary differential equations, we analyze the impact of physiological parameters on the response of the model, and identify the main subsystems generating the complex uterine electrical activity, with respect to physiological data.},

@article{du2013,
	abstract = {Gastric electrical activity, also termed slow wave activity, is generated by a class of pacemaker cells called the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which are organized with decreasing intrinsic frequencies along the stomach. In the healthy stomach, slow waves of different intrinsic frequencies converge to a single frequency with a constant phase-lag, in a process called entrainment. The main aim of this study was to develop a simplified biophysical ICC model that is capable of modeling the self-excitatory behavior and standard morphology of gastric slow waves. Entrainment of gastric slow waves was simulated in a one-dimensional (1D) model, with a linear gradient of intrinsic slow wave frequencies. In a coupled 1D model, the simulated slow waves were entrained to a single frequency; whereas in an uncoupled 1D model, the simulated slow waves occurred at different frequencies, resulting in loss of entrainment. The new cell model presents an option for future large multi-scale simulations of gastric slow waves in intact ICC network and diseased conditions where the loss of entrainment may lead to slow wave dysrhythmias and diminished gastric motility.},

Models of tissue electrophysiology can provide a bridge between electrophysiological cell models at smaller scales, and tissue mechanics, metabolism and blood flow at larger scales. This paper is a critical review of cardiac tissue electrophysiology models, focussing on the micro-structure of cardiac tissue, generic behaviours of action potential propagation, different models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology, the choice of parameter values and tissue geometry, emergent properties in tissue models, numerical techniques and computational issues. We propose a tentative list of information that could be included in published descriptions of tissue electrophysiology models, and used to support interpretation and evaluation of simulation results. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and open questions.},

	abstract = {Parallel numerical simulations of excitation and recovery in three-dimensional myocardial domains are presented. The simulations are based on the anisotropic Bidomain and Monodomain models, including intramural fiber rotation and orthotropic or axisymmetric anisotropy of the intra- and extra-cellular conductivity tensors. The Bidomain model consist of a system of two reaction-diffusion equations, while the Monodomain model consists of one reaction-diffusion equation. Both models are coupled with the phase I Luo-Rudy membrane model describing the ionic currents. Simulations of excitation and repolarization sequences on myocardial slabs of different sizes show how the distribution of the action potential durations (APD) is influenced by both the anisotropic electrical conduction and the fiber rotation. This influence occurs in spite of the homogeneous intrinsic properties of the cell membrane. The APD dispersion patterns are closely correlated to the anisotropic curvature of the excitation wavefront.},

@article{luo1994,
	abstract = {A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular action potential is presented. In our previous work, the membrane Na+ current and K+ currents were formulated. The present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular Ca2+ and depend on its concentration. The model presented here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells with appropriate modifications made to account for species differences. The following processes are formulated: Ca2+ current through the L-type channel (ICa), the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), buffering of Ca2+ in the SR and in the myoplasm, a Ca2+ pump in the sarcolemma, the Na(+)-K+ pump, and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated membrane current. Activation of ICa is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models. Inactivation of ICa depends on both the membrane voltage and [Ca2+]i. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, Ca2+ enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a monoexponential function. Release of Ca2+ occurs at JSR and can be triggered by two different mechanisms, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and spontaneous release. The model provides the basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Such simulations are presented in our accompanying article in this issue of Circulation Research.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian ventricular cell is introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The fast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax = 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in [K]o on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]o, whereas at low [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable responses ("chaotic activity") are observed. The results are consistent with recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.},

@article{wilde1988,
	abstract = {In the pregnant rat, spontaneous electrical activity of circular muscle (CM) changes from single, plateau-type action potentials at early and mid-term to repetitive spike trains at term. To examine mechanisms underlying the plateau, we studied the effects of potassium channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on membrane potentials in CM from rats on gestation Days 14, 15, 16, 21 (term). Apparent membrane conductance was measured at rest and during the plateau in Day 14 muscles with and without TEA. 4-AP depolarized the resting membrane on all gestation days. Therefore, a direct action of 4-AP on plateau configuration could not be separated from an indirect effect of depolarization. TEA did not affect the resting potential but increased action potential size and depolarization rate on all gestation days. On Day 16, TEA reduced plateau amplitude, unmasking small, repetitive depolarizations. D-600 decreased plateau amplitude and duration and attenuated these effects of TEA. Plateau conductance increased initially then decreased before membrane repolarization. Membrane conductance and outward rectification during the plateau were reduced by TEA. The plateau potential may result from an outwardly rectifying TEA-sensitive current combined with a slow inward current, the plateau magnitude being determined by the relative intensity of each current.},

@article{bakker2007,
	abstract = {AIM: To summarize the currently available knowledge on (1) the methods to monitor uterine activity (UA); (2) the units to quantify UA; and (3) to assess the importance of abnormal contraction patterns on the condition of the fetus. The need for correct assessment and interpretation of the uterine contraction curve to improve fetal outcome will be emphasized. STUDY RESULTS: Correct assessment of the uterine contraction curve is an essential part of the cardiotocogram and should be obtained by the best method available; i.e., internal tocography (IT). IT provides objective information on quantization of UA and has the ability to obtain a good quality trace in an obese, restless patient. Accurate information on UA is essential because elevated UA during the first and second stage of labor can increase the risk of adverse fetal outcome. The relaxation time appears to be an important contraction parameter to maintain fetal well-being during labor. Almost all abnormal contraction patterns are characterized by shortening of the relaxation time and can lead to severe asphyxia. Duration, amplitude and frequency of contractions are of importance as well. The mean active pressure unit is the means to quantify UA since it incorporates these three contraction parameters. CONCLUSION: Proper application of UA monitoring by means of the internal method and adequate reading and interpretation of the uterine contraction curve is a prerequisite for high quality electronic fetal heart rate monitoring.},

	abstract = {Uterine smooth muscle cells remain quiescent throughout most of gestation, only generating spontaneous action potentials immediately prior to, and during, labor. This study presents a method that combines transcriptomics with biophysical recordings to characterise the conductance repertoire of these cells, the 'conductance repertoire' being the total complement of ion channels and transporters expressed by an electrically active cell. Transcriptomic analysis provides a set of potential electrogenic entities, of which the conductance repertoire is a subset. Each entity within the conductance repertoire was modeled independently and its gating parameter values were fixed using the available biophysical data. The only remaining free parameters were the surface densities for each entity. We characterise the space of combinations of surface densities (density vectors) consistent with experimentally observed membrane potential and calcium waveforms. This yields insights on the functional redundancy of the system as well as its behavioral versatility. Our approach couples high-throughput transcriptomic data with physiological behaviors in health and disease, and provides a formal method to link genotype to phenotype in excitable systems. We accurately predict current densities and chart functional redundancy. For example, we find that to evoke the observed voltage waveform, the BK channel is functionally redundant whereas hERG is essential. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that activation of calcium-activated chloride conductances by intracellular calcium release is the key factor underlying spontaneous depolarisations.},

	abstract = {1. Voltage-gated K+ currents in human myometrium are not well characterized, and were therefore investigated, using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, in freshly isolated myometrial smooth muscle cells from pregnant women at term. 2. Three types of voltage-gated K+ currents were identified. IK1 was a 4-aminopyridine-insensitive current with a negative half-inactivation (V0.5 = -61 to -67 mV) and negative activation characteristics (threshold between -60 and -40 mV) and slow kinetics. IK2 was a 4-aminopyridine-sensitive current (half-maximal block at approximately 1 mM) with relatively positive half-inactivation (V0.5 = -30 mV) and activation characteristics (threshold between -40 and -30 mV) and faster kinetics. IK,A was a 4-aminopyridine-sensitive current with a negative inactivation and very fast inactivation kinetics. 3. Both IK1 and IK2 were sensitive to high concentrations of tetraethylammonium (half-maximal block at approximately 3 mM) and low concentrations of clofilium (half-maximal block by 3-10 microM). 4. IK1 and IK2 were unevenly distributed between myometrial cells, most cells possessing either IK1 (30 cells) or IK2 (24 cells) as the predominant current. 5. The characteristics of these currents suggest a possible function in the control of membrane potentials and smooth muscle quiescence in the pregnant human myometrium.},

Early CellML-based environments include COR and OpenCell. However, both of those tools have limitations and were eventually replaced with OpenCOR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opencor.ws" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">opencor.ws</ext-link>). OpenCOR is an open source modeling environment that is supported on Windows, Linux and OS X. It relies on a modular approach, which means that all of its features come in the form of plugins. Those plugins can be used to organize, edit, simulate and analyze models encoded in the CellML format. We start with an introduction to CellML and two of its early adopters, which limitations eventually led to the development of OpenCOR. We then go onto describing the general philosophy behind OpenCOR, as well as describing its openness and its development process. Next, we illustrate various aspects of OpenCOR, such as its user interface and some of the plugins that come bundled with it (e.g., its editing and simulation plugins). Finally, we discuss some of the advantages and limitations of OpenCOR before drawing some concluding remarks.},

	abstract = {The properties of hyperpolarization-activated current in pregnant rat uterus (17-19 days gestation) were investigated using microelectrode and patch-clamp techniques, and isometric tension recording. The resting membrane potentials were -58.4 mV and -48.5 mV in longitudinal and circular muscle cells, respectively. Application of hyperpolarizing current pulses produced a time-dependent anomalous inward rectification of membrane potential only in circular muscle cells. Under voltage-clamp conditions, inward currents (Ih) were activated by long hyperpolarizing pulses below -60 mV in circular but not in longitudinal muscle cells. Application of extracellular but not intracellular Cs+ reduced the amplitude of I(h) in a concentration-dependent manner (an IC50( of 0.15 mM). The reversal potential for Ih was -26.2 mV and the slope conductance was 5 nS/pF. Changes in [K+]o and [Na+]o shifted the reversal potential, and Ih amplitude increased with excess [K+]o and decreased with low [Na+]o. The steady-state activation of Ih was well fitted by a Boltzmann equation with a half-activation potential of -84.3 mV and a slope factor of 9.6 mV. Time courses of activation and deactivation of the current strongly depended on membrane potential, and were well fitted by a single exponential function. The activation time constant of Ih was dependent on temperature. In isometric tension recording, application of extracellular Cs+ to the circular muscles reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude, of spontaneous contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. It is concluded that in pregnant rat uterus Ih channels are predominantly distributed in smooth muscle cells from the circular layer. Since Ih is activated at the resting membrane potential, it is likely that this current contributes to the maintenance of resting membrane potential and spontaneous activity in circular smooth muscle cells of late pregnant rats.},

	abstract = {We describe a model for the mechanism by which Ca channel inactivation might depend on calcium entry. Ca is assumed to bind to a site at the internal membrane surface to cause inactivation of Ca channels. We assume that Ca that enters through the membrane accumulates in a submembrane compartment and also make simplifying assumptions about Ca buffering and removal. Our model predicts the results of single- and double-pulse voltage-clamp experiments well. The predicted turn-off of Ca current is non-exponential. The model also predicts that procedures that slow inactivation will increase peak Ca current and suggests that both two-phase turn-off of currents and failure of normalized current to recover to 1.0 in two-pulse experiments may be explained without assuming a voltage-dependent component of inactivation or two populations of Ca channels.},

@article{tong2014,
	abstract = {The uterus and heart share the important physiological feature whereby contractile activation of the muscle tissue is regulated by the generation of periodic, spontaneous electrical action potentials (APs). Preterm birth arising from premature uterine contractions is a major complication of pregnancy and there remains a need to pursue avenues of research that facilitate the use of drugs, tocolytics, to limit these inappropriate contractions without deleterious actions on cardiac electrical excitation. A novel approach is to make use of mathematical models of uterine and cardiac APs, which incorporate many ionic currents contributing to the AP forms, and test the cell-specific responses to interventions. We have used three such models---of uterine smooth muscle cells (USMC), cardiac sinoatrial node cells (SAN), and ventricular cells---to investigate the relative effects of reducing two important voltage-gated Ca currents---the L-type (I<sub>CaL</sub>) and T-type (I<sub>CaT</sub>) Ca currents. Reduction of I<sub>CaL</sub> (10%) alone, or I<sub>CaT</sub> (40%) alone, blunted USMC APs with little effect on ventricular APs and only mild effects on SAN activity. Larger reductions in either current further attenuated the USMC APs but with also greater effects on SAN APs. Encouragingly, a combination of I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>CaT</sub> reduction did blunt USMC APs as intended with little detriment to APs of either cardiac cell type. Subsequent overlapping maps of I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>CaT</sub> inhibition profiles from each model revealed a range of combined reductions of I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>CaT</sub> over which an appreciable diminution of USMC APs could be achieved with no deleterious action on cardiac SAN or ventricular APs. This novel approach illustrates the potential for computational biology to inform us of possible uterine and cardiac cell-specific mechanisms. Incorporating such computational approaches in future studies directed at designing new, or repurposing existing, tocolytics will be beneficial for establishing a desired uterine specificity of action.},

	abstract = {Human-based modelling and simulations are becoming ubiquitous in biomedical science due to their ability to augment experimental and clinical investigations. Cardiac electrophysiology is one of the most advanced areas, with cardiac modelling and simulation being considered for virtual testing of pharmacological therapies and medical devices. Current models present inconsistencies with experimental data, which limit further progress. In this study, we present the design, development, calibration and independent validation of a human-based ventricular model (ToR-ORd) for simulations of electrophysiology and excitation-contraction coupling, from ionic to whole-organ dynamics, including the electrocardiogram. Validation based on substantial multiscale simulations supports the credibility of the ToR-ORd model under healthy and key disease conditions, as well as drug blockade. In addition, the process uncovers new theoretical insights into the biophysical properties of the L-type calcium current, which are critical for sodium and calcium dynamics. These insights enable the reformulation of L-type calcium current, as well as replacement of the hERG current model.},

Though incomplete, this knowledge has been used to construct computer models that represent the activity of this organ as a whole, and of its individual chambers (the atria and ventricles), tissues and cells. Such models have been used to better understand life-threatening irregular heartbeats; they are also beginning to be used to guide decisions about the treatment of patients and the development of new drugs by the pharmaceutical industry. Yet existing computer models of the electrical activity of the human heart are sometimes inconsistent with experimental data. This problem led Tomek et al. to try to create a new model that was consistent with established biophysical knowledge and experimental data for a wide range of conditions including disease and drug action. Tomek et al. designed a strategy that explicitly separated the construction and validation of a model that could recreate the electrical activity of the ventricles in a human heart. This model was able to integrate and explain a wide range of properties of both healthy and diseased hearts, including their response to different drugs. The development of the model also uncovered and resolved theoretical inconsistencies that have been present in almost all models of the heart from the last 25 years. Tomek et al. hope that their new human heart model will enable more basic, translational and clinical research into a range of heart diseases and accelerate the development of new therapies.},

A quantitative description of the intracellular processes whose coordinated activity is believed to generate electrical slow waves has been developed and is presented here. In line with recent experimental evidence, the model describes how the interplay between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum in cycling intracellular Ca(2+) provides the primary regulatory signal for the initiation of the slow wave. The major ion channels that have been identified as influencing slow wave activity have been modeled according to data obtained from isolated ICC. The model has been validated by comparing the simulated profile of the slow waves with experimental recordings and shows good correspondence in terms of frequency, amplitude, and shape in both control and pharmacologically altered conditions.},

@article{tong2011,
	abstract = {Uterine contractions during labor are discretely regulated by rhythmic action potentials (AP) of varying duration and form that serve to determine calcium-dependent force production. We have employed a computational biology approach to develop a fuller understanding of the complexity of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling of uterine smooth muscle cells (USMC). Our overall aim is to establish a mathematical platform of sufficient biophysical detail to quantitatively describe known uterine E-C coupling parameters and thereby inform future empirical investigations of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms governing normal and dysfunctional labors. From published and unpublished data we construct mathematical models for fourteen ionic currents of USMCs: Ca2+ currents (L- and T-type), Na+ current, an hyperpolarization-activated current, three voltage-gated K+ currents, two Ca2+-activated K+ current, Ca2+-activated Cl current, non-specific cation current, Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, Na+-K+ pump and background current. The magnitudes and kinetics of each current system in a spindle shaped single cell with a specified surface area:volume ratio is described by differential equations, in terms of maximal conductances, electrochemical gradient, voltage-dependent activation/inactivation gating variables and temporal changes in intracellular Ca2+ computed from known Ca2+ fluxes. These quantifications are validated by the reconstruction of the individual experimental ionic currents obtained under voltage-clamp. Phasic contraction is modeled in relation to the time constant of changing [Ca2+]i. This integrated model is validated by its reconstruction of the different USMC AP configurations (spikes, plateau and bursts of spikes), the change from bursting to plateau type AP produced by estradiol and of simultaneous experimental recordings of spontaneous AP, [Ca2+]i and phasic force. In summary, our advanced mathematical model provides a powerful tool to investigate the physiological ionic mechanisms underlying the genesis of uterine electrical E-C coupling of labor and parturition. This will furnish the evolution of descriptive and predictive quantitative models of myometrial electrogenesis at the whole cell and tissue levels.},

First, based on the voltage clamp experiments found in the literature, we focus on the principal ionic channels and their cognate currents involved in the generation of this electrical activity. Second, we provide the methodology of formulations of uterine ionic currents derived from a wide range of electrophysiological data. The model is validated step by step by comparing simulated voltage-clamp results with the experimental ones. The model reproduces successfully the generation of single spikes or trains of action potentials that fit with the experimental data. It allows analyzing ionic channels implications.

@article{bursztyn2007,
	abstract = {Uterine contractility is generated by contractions of myometrial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that compose most of the myometrial layer of the uterine wall. Calcium ion (Ca(2+)) entry into the cell can be initiated by depolarization of the cell membrane. The increase in the free Ca(2+) concentration within the cell initiates a chain of reactions, which lead to formation of cross bridges between actin and myosin filaments, and thereby the cell contracts. During contraction the SMC shortens while it exerts forces on neighboring cells. A mathematical model of myometrial SMC contraction has been developed to study this process of excitation and contraction. The model can be used to describe the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and stress produced by the cell in response to depolarization of the cell membrane. The model accounts for the operation of three Ca(2+) control mechanisms: voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) pumps, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers. The processes of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and stress production are accounted for using the cross-bridge model of Hai and Murphy (Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 254: C99-C106, 1988) and are coupled to the Ca(2+) concentration through the rate constant of myosin phosphorylation. Measurements of Ca(2+), MLC phosphorylation, and force in contracting cells were used to set the model parameters and test its ability to predict the cell response to stimulation. The model has been used to reproduce results of voltage-clamp experiments performed in myometrial cells of pregnant rats as well as the results of simultaneous measurements of MLC phosphorylation and force production in human nonpregnant myometrial cells.},

	abstract = {The muscular layer of the uterus (myometrium) undergoes profound changes in global excitability prior to parturition. Here, a mathematical model of the myocyte network is developed to investigate the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity is essential to the transition from local to global excitation which the myometrium undergoes just prior to birth. Each myometrial smooth muscle cell is represented by an element with FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics. The cells are coupled through resistors that represent gap junctions. Spatial heterogeneity is introduced by means of stochastic variation in coupling strengths, with parameters derived from physiological data. Numerical simulations indicate that even modest increases in the heterogeneity of the system can amplify the ability of locally applied stimuli to elicit global excitation. Moreover, in networks driven by a pacemaker cell, global oscillations of excitation are impeded in fully connected and strongly coupled networks. The ability of a locally stimulated cell or pacemaker cell to excite the network is shown to be strongly dependent on the local spatial correlation structure of the couplings. In summary, spatial heterogeneity is a key factor in enhancing and modulating global excitability.},

@article{afsar2021,
	abstract = {The predictive accuracy of mathematical models representing anything ranging from the meteorological to the biological system profoundly depends on the quality of model parameters derived from experimental data. Hence, robust sensitivity analysis (SA) of these critical model parameters aids in sifting the influential from the negligible out of typically vast parameter regimes, thus illuminating key components of the system under study. We here move beyond traditional local sensitivity analysis to the adoption of global SA techniques. Partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) based on Latin hypercube sampling is compared with the variance-based Sobol method. We selected for this SA investigation an infection model for the hepatitis-B virus (HBV) that describes infection dynamics and clearance of HBV in the liver [Murray & Goyal, 2015]. The model tracks viral particles such as the tenacious and nearly ineradicable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) embedded in infected nuclei and an HBV protein known as p36. Our application of these SA methods to the HBV model illuminates, especially over time, the quantitative relationships between cccDNA synthesis rate and p36 synthesis and export. Our results reinforce previous observations that the viral protein, p36, is by far the most influential factor for cccDNA replication. Moreover, both methods are capable of finding crucial parameters of the model. Though the Sobol method is independent of model structure (e.g., linearity and monotonicity) and well suited for SA, our results ensure that LHS-PRCC suffices for SA of a non-linear model if it is monotonic.},

	abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model of arterial vasomotion in which irregular rhythmic activity is generated by the nonlinear interaction of intracellular and membrane oscillators that depend on cyclic release of Ca2+ from internal stores and cyclic influx of extracellular Ca2+, respectively. Four key control variables were selected on the basis of the pharmacological characteristics of histamine-induced vasomotion in rabbit ear arteries: Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, Ca2+ concentration in ryanodine-sensitive stores, cell membrane potential, and the open state probability of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Although not represented by independent dynamic variables, the model also incorporates Na+/Ca2+ exchange, the Na+-K+-ATPase, Cl- fluxes, and Ca2+ efflux via the extrusion ATPase. Simulations reproduce a wide spectrum of experimental observations, including 1) the effects of interventions that modulate the functionality of Ca2+ stores and membrane ion channels, 2) paradoxes such as the apparently unpredictable dual action of Ca2+ antagonists and low extracellular Na+ concentration, which can abolish vasomotion or promote the appearance of large-amplitude oscillations, and 3) period-doubling, quasiperiodic, and intermittent routes to chaos. Nonlinearity is essential to explain these diverse patterns of experimental vascular response.},

	abstract = {Phase space methods and an analog computer are used to analyze the Hodgkin-Huxley non-linear differential equations for the squid giant axon membrane. V is the membrane potential, m the Na(+) activation, h the Na(+) inactivation, and n the K(+) activation. V and m change rapidly, relative to h and n. The (V, m) phase plane of a reduced system of equations, with h and n held constant at their resting values, has three singular points: a stable resting point, a threshold saddle point, and a stable excited point. When h and n are allowed to vary, recovery and refractoriness result from the movement with subsequent disappearance of the threshold and excited points. Multiplying the time constant of n by 100 or more, and that of h by one-third, reproduces the experimental plateau action potentials obtained with tetraethylammonium by Tasaki and Hagiwara, including the phenomena of abolition and of refractoriness of the plateau duration. The equations have, transiently, two stable states, as found in the real axon by these authors. Since the theoretical membrane conductance curves differ significantly from the experimental ones, further experimental analysis of ionic currents with tetraethylammonium is needed to decide whether the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be generalized to explain these experiments completely.},

	abstract = {Preterm labor is an important public health problem. However, the efficiency of the uterine muscle during labor is complex and still poorly understood. This work is a first step towards a model of the uterine muscle, including its electrical and mechanical components, to reach a better understanding of the uterus synchronization. This model is proposed to investigate, by simulation, the possible role of mechanotransduction for the global synchronization of the uterus. The electrical diffusion indeed explains the local propagation of contractile activity, while the tissue stretching may play a role in the synchronization of distant parts of the uterine muscle. This work proposes a multi-physics (electrical, mechanical) and multi-scales (cell, tissue, whole uterus) model, which is applied to a realistic uterus 3D mesh. This model includes electrical components at different scales: generation of action potentials at the cell level, electrical diffusion at the tissue level. It then links these electrical events to the mechanical behavior, at the cellular level (via the intracellular calcium concentration), by simulating the force generated by each active cell. It thus computes an estimation of the intra uterine pressure (IUP) by integrating the forces generated by each active cell at the whole uterine level, as well as the stretching of the tissue (by using a viscoelastic law for the behavior of the tissue). It finally includes at the cellular level stretch activated channels (SACs) that permit to create a loop between the mechanical and the electrical behavior (mechanotransduction). The simulation of different activated regions of the uterus, which in this first ''proof of concept'' case are electrically isolated, permits the activation of inactive regions through the stretching (induced by the electrically active regions) computed at the whole organ scale. This permits us to evidence the role of the mechanotransduction in the global synchronization of the uterus. The results also permit us to evidence the effect on IUP of this enhanced synchronization induced by the presence of SACs. This proposed simplified model will be further improved in order to permit a better understanding of the global uterine synchronization occurring during efficient labor contractions.},

	abstract = {Intestinal bioelectrical slow waves are a key regulator of intestinal motility. Peripheral pacemakers, ectopic initiations and sustained periods of re-entrant activities have all been experimentally observed to be important factors in setting the frequency of intestinal slow waves, but the tissue-level mechanisms underpinning these activities are unclear. This theoretical analysis aimed to define the initiation, maintenance, and termination criteria of two classes of intestinal re-entrant activities: anatomical re-entry and functional re-entry. Anatomical re-entry was modeled in a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical model, and functional rotor was modeled in a 2D rectangle model. A single-pulse stimulus was used to invoke an anatomical re-entry and a prolonged refractory block was used to invoke the rotor. In both cases, the simulated re-entrant activities operated at frequencies above the baseline entrainment frequency. The anatomical re-entry simulation results demonstrated that a temporary functional refractory block would be required to initiate the re-entrant activity in a single direction around the cylindrical model. The rotor could be terminated by a single-pulse stimulus delivered around the core of the rotor. In conclusion, the simulation results provide the following new insights into the mechanisms of intestinal re-entry: (i) anatomical re-entry is only maintained within a specific range of velocities, outside of which the re-entrant activities become either an ectopic activity or simultaneous activations of the intestinal wall; (ii) a maintained rotor entrained slow waves faster in the antegrade direction than in the retrograde direction. Simulations are shown to be a valuable tool for achieving novel insights into the mechanisms of intestinal slow wave dysrhythmia.},

	abstract = {Human-based computational modelling and simulation are powerful tools to accelerate the mechanistic understanding of cardiac patho-physiology, and to develop and evaluate therapeutic interventions. The aim of this study is to calibrate and evaluate human ventricular electro-mechanical models for investigations on the effect of the electro-mechanical coupling and pharmacological action on human ventricular electrophysiology, calcium dynamics, and active contraction. The most recent models of human ventricular electrophysiology, excitation-contraction coupling, and active contraction were integrated, and the coupled models were calibrated using human experimental data. Simulations were then conducted using the coupled models to quantify the effects of electro-mechanical coupling and drug exposure on electrophysiology and force generation in virtual human ventricular cardiomyocytes and tissue. The resulting calibrated human electro-mechanical models yielded active tension, action potential, and calcium transient metrics that are in agreement with experiments for endocardial, epicardial, and mid-myocardial human samples. Simulation results correctly predicted the inotropic response of different multichannel action reference compounds and demonstrated that the electro-mechanical coupling improves the robustness of repolarisation under drug exposure compared to electrophysiology-only models. They also generated additional evidence to explain the partial mismatch between in-silico and in-vitro experiments on drug-induced electrophysiology changes. The human calibrated and evaluated modelling and simulation framework constructed in this study opens new avenues for future investigations into the complex interplay between the electrical and mechanical cardiac substrates, its modulation by pharmacological action, and its translation to tissue and organ models of cardiac patho-physiology.},
